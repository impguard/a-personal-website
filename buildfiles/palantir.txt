At Palantir, I worked with 3 other interns to build an interactive web app for the Metropolis team that served as a prototype of how their Swing-Java dominated codebase would look like in the web. The goal was to serve as a stepping stone as most of Palantir's software projects moved from a client side app to a web-based service. During this time, I maintained unit tests using Mocha and Gerrit and utilized a GruntJS based build system. I was also in charge of maintaining a Wiki page documenting our research, code infrastructure, and design decisions.

Palantir utilized the Scrum framework of Agile development, and I took part in daily standups with my project partners, weekly standups with my group, and 3 week sprints among the Metropolis team. I commonly served as the Scrum master, ensuring that we produce valuable code that would be used in the future when we left.

At the company-wide hackathon, I also participated in building some great side projects. The first was a simple Javascript library built on top of D3.js that converted a JSON file to an interactive SVG chart. The second was a hardware based "shower tracker" that utilized a Rasberry PI server and an Arduino client to track shower usage at the company to help employees determine which showers were currently taken.
