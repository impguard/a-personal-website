I am a <span>hacker</span>. I love making things. As a developer, I love coming up with an idea and being able to immediately execute it to produce something that people can play with and enjoy. I am always full of crazy ideas - some useful and some not - that I am constantly trying to implement. Some of these ideas end up becoming really great projects while others might just be "learning experiences". Regardless, I am always up for diving into the unknown and making something really cool.
