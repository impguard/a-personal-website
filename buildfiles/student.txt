I am a <span>student</span>. Despite having spent a large chunk of my life at college, I have found that I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that drives me to learn no matter where I am. I feel that the best way to grow as a developer, designer, and person is to always be bringing in new ideas and perspectives. By pushing the boundaries of what I can do, I can show that I am a multifaceted individual who can bring a lot to the table.
