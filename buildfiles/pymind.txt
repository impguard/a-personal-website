I decided to create PyMind after learning about neural networks in an online AI course. The goal was to create a simple tool that allowed a user to quickly built a neural network, train it on a data set, and use the corresponding results. The entire library took around 2 months to realize and utilized an extensive amount of tests with the Nose testing framework. In order to ensure speed, the bulk of the heavy lifting was done with Numpy and SciPy in order to ensure great performance while Python was used for its flexibility and popularity amongst researchers.
