I decided to create PyMind after learning about neural networks in an online AI course. The goal was to create a simple tool that allowed a user to quickly build a neural network, train it on a data set, and use the corresponding results. The entire library took around 2 months to realize and utilized an extensive amount of tests with the Nose testing framework. In order to ensure speed, the bulk of the heavy lifting was done with Numpy and SciPy in order to ensure great performance while Python was used for its flexibility and popularity amongst researchers.

The core project revolved around some very simple code and an implementation of backtracking and forward propagation. The main goal was to hide many of the steps of using a neural network and to provide a simple interface where a researcher could simply pass in his data, choose his optimization function, and begin training. We also created a suite of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end system tests to ensure that our implementation was working properly. Although not a particularly great statistic for how successful our testing was, the tests did achieve over 95% coverage of our code. This was a great example of taking something that I learned at school and using it immediately to create something cool.
