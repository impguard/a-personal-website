I worked as a Project Manager at Microsoft handing a piece of the next update of the Windows Store. During this time, I gained valuable insight into the world of UX and developing a product that may be used by thousands of different people. I was in charge of maintaining a component of the Store, setting up and attending meetings with other PM's and developers in order to ensure that all aspects of my project would be flushed out and ready to be shipped by the end of the milestone.
