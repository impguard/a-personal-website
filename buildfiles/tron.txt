Tron was a one day hackathon project that had us creating a very simple web based 3D game that utilized a computer's webcam in order to recognize a person's hands steering an imaginary steering wheel. Inspired by the popular arcade game, we created a simple 3D game world using three.js and a simple inhouse image processing algorithm to drive a virtual car. Although we aspired to completely imitate Tron and its rules, we were only able to create a simple demo where a user could drive the car around a 3d space. Nevertheless, we were able to take first place at the CSUA hackathon among its 15 teams, resulting a cool and successful 1 day hack.
