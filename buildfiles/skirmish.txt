Not every project is a success, and Skirmish was one of my first attempts at a large project that was never fully realized. Working with two of my housemates, we created a simple real time strategy game in Java. The project incorporated a lot of moving parts: a pathfinding algorithm on top of a simple A* search to ensure clumps of colliding units could path around one another smoothly, a rendering engine that properly handled fog of war and the various game sprites, a modular infrastructure where unit properties could be tweaked on the go, and a server-client system that could connect players together to allow them to start a new game.

We made large progress in all of these elements and even demoed a playable prototype at a small hackathon. The units could path around the map successfully, simple battle mechanics were implemented, and a chat client that served as the game launcher was created. However, the game was finally scrapped due to our inability to get a handle on the realtime component over an unstable network and our lack of experience with video game graphics. We simply could not reach a level of quality that we were comfortable with. Nevertheless, it was an amazing learning experience and a very fun project to work on and design.
