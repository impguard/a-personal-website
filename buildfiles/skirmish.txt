Not every project is a success, and Skirmish was one of my first attempts at a large project. Working with my two housemates, we created a simple real time strategy game in Java. This project incorporated a lot of moving parts, including a pathfinding algorithm on top of a simple A* search to ensure clumps of colliding units could path around one another smoothly, a rendering engine that properly handled fog of war and the various game sprites, a modular infrastructure where unit properties could be tweaked on the go, and a server-client system so multiple clients could start a game together.

Although we made large progress in all of these elements, the game was finally scrapped due to our inability to get handle the realtime component over a network. Nevertheless, it was an amazing learning experience and a very fun project to work on and design.
