I'm a <span>gamer</span>. Sitting down and exploring a fantasy world or engaging with others in a competitive shooter is something that I find extremely entertaining and fun. However, it isn't just the game that excites me. What I find really inspiring is the creativity and passion that the developers have when designing and creating this virtual reality for others to spend their time in. Being able to produce a world and a story that is convincing enough to engage players is something that I hope to reproduce in order to create products that are just as captivating.
