Instaparser was built as a convenience tool mainly targeted at hackathon coders and students. We developed a simple language that could be used to specify the format of an input file, which is used to automatically generate a full fledged parser in either C++, Java, or Python. The parser would simply be a bootstrapping of the project, allowing the developer to then focus on his algorithm or solving the problem using the data in the files. The entire project was written in Python using the Nose testing framework.

In addition to building the script, we also designed a website to showcase the project, provide instructions, and allow users to use the script quickly online instead of downloading it themselves. The website was my first attempt at spending a large amount of time designing before touching the code. After creating a few mockups in Adobe Illustrator, I was able to build the website in less than a week. The only remaining goals for this project are filling the website with content and squashing some final bugs within Instaparser's codebase.
